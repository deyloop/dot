# Prefix Key: rebind to C-Space.
#
# Matches vim leader key, which is Space
# Easier to type as compare to C-a as the pinky finger has to move and the 
# thumb is close to space at all times. In case of C-a, the finder next to 
# the little finder will have to move to A, which is not in the column it 
# should go to. 

unbind C-a
set -g prefix C-a

# The above is global. When using nested tmux sessions, the prefix for a
# particular pane can be adjusted using `C-Space :` and then 
# `set -p prefix <new prefix>`
# to avoid conflict.

# Pane splitting

# v and h are not bound by default, but to be forward compatible:
unbind v
unbind h

unbind %	# default for vertical split
unbind '"'	# default for horizontal split

bind | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"


# Navigating between panes

unbind Up
unbind Down
unbind Left
unbind Right

# Had these bindings be without the prefix keys, but decided to keep them
# behind the prefix in order to not conflict with some vim keybindings
# (like C-x C-l for line completion)
